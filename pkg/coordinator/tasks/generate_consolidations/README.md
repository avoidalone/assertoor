## `generate_consolidations` Task

### Description
The `generate_consolidations` task is designed to create and send consolidation transactions to the Ethereum network. Consolidations are specialized transactions used for consolidating multiple validator balances into a single validator, optimizing the management and operation of validators within the network.

### Configuration Parameters

- **`limitPerSlot`**: 
  Specifies the maximum number of consolidations allowed per slot. This helps manage the network load and ensures that the slot does not get overwhelmed with consolidation requests.

- **`limitTotal`**: 
  Sets an upper limit on the total number of consolidations that can be generated by this task. This is useful for controlling overall network traffic and ensuring system stability.

- **`sourceMnemonic`**: 
  The mnemonic phrase used to derive the source validators' keys. These are the validators from which balances will be consolidated.

- **`targetMnemonic`**: 
  The mnemonic phrase used to derive the target validator's key. This is the validator to which the balances will be consolidated.

- **`sourceStartIndex`**: 
  The starting index within the source mnemonic for deriving validator keys. This specifies the beginning of the range of source validators involved in the consolidation.

- **`sourceIndexCount`**: 
  The number of source validator keys to derive from the mnemonic, determining how many validators' balances will be consolidated.

- **`targetValidator`**: 
  An identifier for the target validator, typically a number representing its position or index.

- **`targetIndex`**: 
  The specific index of the target validator within the target mnemonic sequence. This pinpoints the exact validator to which all balances will be directed.

- **`consolidationEpoch`**: 
  The epoch during which the consolidation is to take place. This ensures that the consolidation aligns with specific blockchain epochs, adhering to timing requirements.

- **`clientPattern`**: 
  A regex pattern for selecting specific client endpoints to send the consolidations. This allows for precise targeting of clients capable of processing these types of transactions.

- **`excludeClientPattern`**: 
  A regex pattern to exclude certain clients from being used to send the consolidations. This provides an additional layer of control by preventing specific clients from handling these transactions, which can be important for security or performance reasons.
